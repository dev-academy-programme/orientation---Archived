## Student and Guest Anti-Harassment Policy

This policy governs the behavior of students, guides, and staff in Phase 0 and includes any work, communications, or other interactions you have with people associated with Dev Academy. In addition, this policy covers students, alumni, staff, and guests in our locations, spaces, or any gathering related to EDA.

**We expect all Dev Academy-affiliated persons to follow this policy.**

## Quick version

Dev Academy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment and experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at Dev Academy, including talks.  Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave the program or space without a refund at the discretion of Dev Academy staff.

## Long version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Dev Academy alumni, employers, and guests are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dev Academy Staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Dev Academy; for students this means expulsion from the program with no refund; for others, this includes expulsion or banning from the Dev Academy space with no refund, if applicable.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of Dev Academy Staff immediately.

Dev Academy Staff will be happy to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of their time in Phase 0 and at Dev Academy.
