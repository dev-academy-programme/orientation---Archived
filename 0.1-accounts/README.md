# Create Accounts!


Ngā mihi nui kia koutou katoa! Warm greetings to you all! Welcome to Dev Academy.

You will need to set up each of these accounts before starting Phase 0. The general rule of thumb is to **use your first name as part of your username wherever possible** and include a photo of yourself (i.e. not your cat or bike). This helps us (the EDA community of staff, teachers, coaches and alumni) to better support you.

- [Google](https://accounts.google.com/Signup): Your personal email address needs to be linked to google. When signing up, select the option "I prefer to use my own email address." You can skip this step if you are using gmail.

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/): Github will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face to help us recognise you.

- [Github](https://github.com/): Please create an account with **your first name as part of your github user name.** This will be where you keep all of your code from EDA and becomes your technical resume when applying for positions. The most popular form for github usernames is to use "snake-case": all lowercase letters with words separated by hyphens, e.g., bobs-yer-uncle. Remember that this name will be used by you professionally, so don't make the mistake of  using something you wouldn't want potential employers or clients to see. Make sure it sends the right message.

## Accept Invitations
Inviations are sent out 2-5 days before phase-0 begin. Only then will these links work.

- [Slack](/slack.md): Slack is where cohort communications and technical support happens. **Please download the [desktop app](https://slack.com/apps)** and have it open when working on the material.

- [Google groups / Google drive](https://drive.google.com/a/enspiral.com/folderview?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgeWZoQm9VaWJQeWc&usp=sharing): This is a mailing list for your cohort (e.g. Kakapo-2015@devacademy.co.nz) and provides access to learning materials stored on the student drive.

- [TeamTreehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home): Teamtreehouse is a collection of video tutorials which will support your learning journey. EDA will provide an account for you to use during the duration of phase-0.

## Optional
- [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/): Meetup is the channel by which we advertise our coding events. Its also a great resource to find out what tech events are happening in your region. If choosing to sign up, we recommend changing the [default email settings](http://www.meetup.com/account/comm/) to reduce the number of emails.
