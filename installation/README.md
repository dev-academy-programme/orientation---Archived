# Installation


At EDA you'll be using three tools every day: a terminal, an editor and Git. You'll also need a web browser of course, and for consistency we suggest you use Google Chrome. We'll be installing the following:

1. iTerm2 (Mac) or Babun(Windows)
2. Homebrew (Mac only)
3. Git
4. VS code

---
## OS X (Mac) instructions

### iTerm and Homebrew

1. Navigate to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
2. Download and install it
3. Navigate to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and copy/paste the command on the Homebrew homepage into an open iTerm2 window

> Context: Mac's come with an inbuilt command line called 'terminal', however iTerm2 is our terminal of choice. Homebrew helps us update install and manage 'packages' that you'll need and want to use when coding.

---
### Git

1. Open up iTerm2 Once you've installed Homebrew, type the following commands in iTerm2:
2. Type the following command in iTerm2

```
brew update
brew install git
```

3. Once git is installed, Quit and Restart iTerm2 and enter the following commands:
  ```
  git config --global user.name <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE>
  git config --global user.email <YOUR GITHUB EMAIL ADDRESS HERE>

  ```

### Visual Studio Code (VS code)

1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip, and drag the app into your applications folder

> Context: VS code is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor, before pushing it up onto the web via terminal and GitHub.

4. Follow the Instructions to set up VS Code commands in the Command Line

## Windows instructions

> Context: The Windows development environment can be a little tricky to set up correctly, mostly because of the lack of a good terminal. One option is to dual-boot Linux, a way of installing a development setup without sacrificing your current operating system. There are some good guides available to set this up. However it's probably not something you want to try first if you're just starting out and not feeling very confident.

### Babun (terminal)

1. Go to [Babun](https://babun.GitHub.io)
2. Follow the download and install instructions

> Context: Babun is quite a similar way of working to the Mac and Linux terminals, and will allow you to follow most of Phase 0 without installing other software.

---
### Git

1. Go to [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.GitHub.io/)
2. Follow the install instructions

**Important**
- Git for Windows comes with Git BASH (command line/text) and a graphical version
- During the course, use only Git BASH
- Where instructions talk about using command line or terminal, use Git Bash

3. Open Git Bash and enter the following commands:
  ```
  git config --global user.name <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE>
  git config --global user.email <YOUR GITHUB EMAIL ADDRESS HERE>

  ```


---
### Visual Studio Code (VS code)

1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip and intstall it in your programs directory

> Context: VS code is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor, before pushing it up onto the web via terminal and GitHub.

```


2. Restart your terminal and enter the following commands:
  ```
  git config --global user.name <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE>

  git config --global user.email <YOUR GITHUB EMAIL ADDRESS HERE>
  ```


>Context: If you like, you can check it's working by typing `git`. You should see some help text explaining how to use Git.
