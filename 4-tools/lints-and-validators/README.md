# Lints and validators

In programming, a *lint* or *linter* is "any tool that flags suspicious usage in software written in any computer language" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29)). Throughout your career, you should take advantage of any linter that's available to check your code for mistakes, errors of style, and other questionable code. Why not? It's free, and it can save you a lot of misery.

Another common tool is the *validator*, which tests whether code meets a particular standard as published by a standards organization.

In Phase 0 there are several lints and validators that will help you to write correct, standards-compliant, and even elegant code:

- [The W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- [The W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
- [The WebAIM WAVE accessibility tool](http://wave.webaim.org/)
- [AccessLint](http://accesslint.com/)

Atom has many linter packages, some of which we've included in the install instructions elsewhere in this manual.

You can also lint your JSON online with [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/).

Use them!
