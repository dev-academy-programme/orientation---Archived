# Slack communication channel

[The Enspiral-Dev-Academy slack channel](https://enspiral-dev-academy.slack.com/messages/general/) is where most of our communications will take place.
First off, you'll need an invitation to join the channel so have a dig around your inbox and filtered folders for the invitation. When you find it and join up, you will be auto automatically added to our core channels:

1. **A cohort specific channel**: For cohort communication.. say for example finding a partner to pair with.
2. **A helpdesk channel**: Where you can ask for help on a specific thing.
3. **A general channel**: Stuff everyone in the EDA community should know about. For example, events, announcements, congratulating people.. that sort of stuff.
4. **A random channel**: for random stuff like Web development jokes.
5. **An ideas-and-feedback channel** : For cool things and improvements.

## Your username (important)
To better identify people on slack we would like everyone to standardise there slack user names.
This is not a built in feature of slack so we will follow the pattern of

firstName_lastNameINITIAL_cohort

**For students, please include**

1. First name
2. Last name initial
3. Cohort
4. Stream cs or rb

Example:  Donald_D_Kakapo_C#

## Do
- Do use Slack to get technical assistance

## Don't
- Don't use Slack for extension requests
- Don't use Slack for communications with EDA staff that are non-technical

## Using slack
- We recommend that anytime you are working on the material you have the [slack app](https://slack.com/downloads)
- To see who is in the channel, click the 'i' icon in the top right corner.
- If you have a specific question for someone you can direct message them - but keep in mind that others in the community might know the answer too, so don't cut yourself off from the pool of community knowledge by posting unnecessary private messages.
- You can tag someone in your post by putting an @ in front of their user name. If they are not online, they will be notified via email.
- If you want the whole group to know something, you can use @channel. This will send an email to everyone in the channel. Nonetheless *less refrain from using @channel for channels that are not the cohort channel.
