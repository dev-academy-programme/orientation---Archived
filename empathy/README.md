# Engineering empathy

Here at EDA we do more than create web developers - we develop people. We run a reflective, human curriculum which will be woven through your technical development, giving you the skills to communicate, lead, pair, and work well in a team. These skills are highly sought after&mdash;which is why we teach them.

It's likely that on this course the thing you will learn most most about is yourself (and you'll be learning a lot of tech!!!).

We deliver the human material in a wide variety of creative and exciting ways. In Phase 0 it will mostly be through videos and reading material.

Previous students have reported the following benefits, among others:

- Increased empathy
- Better relationships with fellow students that extend to their lives outside of the course as well
- Increased self-confidence
- Increased self-awareness
- The ability to learn more quickly, take in more information, and grasp complex systems more easily
- Adaptability in any situation
- Comfort in dealing with conflict and with difficult conversations
- The ability to give, receive, and integrate feedback

Some of what we will be referencing is included in *Search Inside Yourself*, which you will be expected to read and utilize throughout Phase 0, and, indeed, throughout the on-site course as well.

You can find a copy we've shared with you in your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) by searching for 'search inside'.

Through the course, you will learn a lot from the other members of your cohort. Engineering empathy will really help unlock these learnings. If you want to get a head start, meet up with the other lovely people on your cohort throughout phase 0 to discuss & explore. They will be able to teach you things, if you're open to it. You'll be able to share your hard-won skills with them, which will crystalise your knowledge further, and identify any gaps to be filled.

Connecting takes some time and energy. It may sometimes feel like a diversion from achieving your technical goals. There is an african proverb: 
  
  "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"
  
In our experience, this is true. Your cohort is a valuable resource - connect, share & collaborate!
