## About accessibility

Throughout this course, we'll be focusing on making web sites and applications that are accessible to and usable by anyone, anywhere, anytime. It's a matter of social justice, it's a matter of designing for the user&mdash;*all* users&mdash;and it's a matter of professionalism.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility):

> Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality.

To learn a bit about accessibility before we get started, please take a few moments to watch [Keeping Web Accessibility in Mind](https://youtu.be/yx7hdQqf8lE). If you have comments or feedback, please feel free to share them on the class Slack channel.
