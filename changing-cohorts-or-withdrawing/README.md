# Changing Cohorts or Withdrawing

## Repeating in Phase 0

If you are having a hard time working through the content, you may opt to repeat Phase 0. Repeating gives you a second chance to complete the challenges you struggled with or did not complete.

Here are a few things to note if you are considering repeating Phase 0:

* You will need to submit all work again in your new cohort.
* You must re-do all challenges for the weeks you are repeating.
* EDA can ask a student to repeat if they have not met the expectations to a reasonable standard.
* EDA reserves the right to restrict the number of times a student repeats a phase.
* You will need to complete the [change of cohort form](http://goo.gl/forms/WHZK8bbvlK)

If repeating is an option you want to explore more, please talk to your facilitator. Remember that there may be a wait before the next cohort starts, so take that into consideration when making your decision. We recognise that students make significant sacrifices and rearrange their lives in order to make study work, so we do try to avoid roll backs wherever possible.


## Deferring to a Later Cohort

If now is not a good time to attend Dev Academy, you may opt to defer to a later cohort. Most of the time, this means moving to a cohort that has not started Phase 0 yet.


## Withdrawing from Phase 0

If you have decided to leave the program, there are a few steps we ask you to take to do this.

**If you have not started Phase 0** yet, or are in the Week 0 module, please contact both <mailto:admissions@devacademy.co.nz> and your Phase 0 facilitator to let us know of your decision.

You will need to complete the [withdrawal form](http://goo.gl/forms/heEV7aH0zh).
