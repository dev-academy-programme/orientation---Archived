# Changing Cohorts or Withdrawing

## Repeating in Phase 0

If you are having a hard time working through the content, you may opt to repeat a unit (Unit 1: Weeks 1-3, Unit 2: Weeks 4-6, Unit 3: Weeks 7-9). Repeating gives you a second chance to complete the challenges you struggled with or did not complete.

Here are a few things to note if you are considering repeating a Unit of Phase 0:
* You will need to submit all work for the prior units again in your new course.
* You must re-do all challenges for the weeks you are repeating.
* EDA can ask a student to repeat if they have not met the expectations to a reasonable standard
* EDA reserves the right to restrict the number of times a student repeats a phase.

If repeating is an option you want to explore more, please message Jaime [mailto:jaime@devacademy.co.nz]

## Deferring to a Later Cohort

If now is not a good time to attend Dev Academy, you may opt to defer to a later cohort. Most of the time, this means moving to a cohort that has not started Phase 0 yet.

## Taking Breaks
Phase 0 is a highly-structured program and there are no opportunities to take breaks in Phase 0 (with the exception of Christmas / New Year break). If you are in Phase 0, we expect you to be in an active cohort. In most cases, it is not possible to take a 3 week break between Week 6 and 7, for example.

This policy aims at helping you adapt to the Dev Academy learning culture. If you are having a lot of difficulty with the learning environment presented, Dev Academy may not be the best place for your to achieve your goal of becoming a developer.

## Withdrawing from Phase 0
If you have decided to leave the program, there are a few steps we ask you to take to do this.

**If you have not started Phase 0** yet, or are in the Week 0 module, please contact both <mailto:admissions@devacademy.co.nz> and your phase-0 facilitator to let us know of your decision.
