## Introduction

Phase 0 aims to familiarise you to the learning culture we foster at Ensprial Dev Academy (EDA). EDA is not a traditional school. We expect each person to be here because they want to be here and they want to become a web developer. To that effect, we expect each person to take responsibility for their own learning, which includes exposing their ignorance, tracking their own progress, and reaching out when they have questions or need help. EDA is fundamentally about learning with a community, and this community will provide support and guidance you need to accomplish your goal. The Phase 0 staff are only a small part of that community. Your peers will be the main support you have during the Phase 0 (and EDA) journey. The Phase 0 staff are here to provide support; we just ask that you initiate the conversation.

Another important thing to note about this learning style is it's not necessarily about the right answer or the most perfect code. It is about your own, honest, best attempt at tackling the challenge. Sometimes, your attempts will not even produce a working solution, and that is OK. If your solution ends up being 30 lines of pseudocode and you don't know where to begin, make a comment saying where you are stuck and submit it. Then you can reach out for more help (from other members of your cohort or from EDA staff) in order to complete the challenge.

## Expectations

1. Commit and push often!
2. Complete weekly challenges/deliverables
3. Submit weekly feedback form
4. Communicate if there are circumstances that will effect your ability to hand in work on time.

Each Monday you will have a weeks worth of material and deliverables that will be given to you via GitHub. We expect that you will work incrementally on the material and have it completed by Sunday 11:59pm. At the end of each week you will need to complete a feedback form in addition to your final push.

## Pairing

Pair programming has gained in popularity among companies by enabling developers to learn from each other and make fewer mistakes. Pair programming can enable both partners to learn and grow if communication is open, friendly, and based on mutual trust and respect. The skills needed to be a good pair will strengthen with practice, which is why we encourage pair programming in Phase 0!

While it is not mandatory, we recommend pairing twice per week, but that is up to you.

## Show up with Integrity, Kindness and Effort

At EDA, we are asking you to do a crazy thing: learn how to be a web developer within a matter of weeks. For you to reach this goal, we need everyone to work together, follow our methodology, and agree to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have made EDA successful.

To outline these rules we have three agreements that guide the actions of everyone in the EDA community (staff, students, and alumni). They are Integrity, Kindness and Effort. We expect every person to uphold these values every day, throughout the entirety of the programme. By enrolling in EDA, you are implicitly agreeing to uphold these agreements. If at any time you are not upholding any of these agreements, you will be asked to leave the program.

Please read about [The Three Agreements](/9-information/three-agreements).
